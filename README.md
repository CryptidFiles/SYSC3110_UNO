# SYSC 3110 UNO Flip

## Overview
**UNO FLIP!** plays just like classic UNO, but with a twist! Every card has **two sides**: a **Light Side** and a **Dark Side**.

The game begins on the **Light Side**, but when a player plays a **FLIP** card,**deck**, **discard pile**, and every player’s **hand** are flipped to the opposite side.

The **Dark Side** introduces new action cards with **tougher penalties** and higher stakes. Players continue playing on this side until another **FLIP** card is played, switching the game back to the **Light Side**.

Play alternates between both sides until a player has played all the cards in their hand, ending the game.
